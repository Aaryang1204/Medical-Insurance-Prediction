For building a prediction model, I have used ,
pandas for data manipulation purposes
numpy to create arrays or matrices
pyplot module to provides a simple interface to create various types of line plots, bar charts etc.
seaborn for statistical data visualization which offers a high-level interface to create attractive and informative statistical graphics.
scikit-learn for predictive data analysis, preprocessing, and model selection (such as train_test_split, linear regression, metrics)

Features such as age, bmi, children, region were taken into account.
Target feature was charges.

A model was trained using the Features and Target Features which was then used by Linear Regression to get a prediction model.

The repository features the main code at MedicalInsurance2.ipynb and the csv file insurance.csv taken from kaggle.com(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mirichoi0218/insurance?resource=download).
